# Fluid-Dynamics-for-Beginners
Two short introductory tutorials on mathematical notation (tensor calculus) and basic fluid dynamics for researchers interested in microfluidics. This is also accompanied by a short illustrative Matlab tutorial.

# Installation
1. Download all files.
2. Open the fluiddynamicstutorial.m file in Matlab.
3. Execute cell by cell while following along in the two tutorials.

# How to use this repository
This repository contains two pdf tutorial documents and an accompanying Matlab tutorial m-script. The basic purpose of this repository is to give a short introduction into the mathematical and physical basics of fluid mechanics. This tutorial is aimed at biologists and other basic science researchers who need to quantify fluid flows and fluid dynamics as part of their research. The two tutorials are accompanied by a matlab script that hopefully illustrates some of the finer points of working with such data.

1)<b> tensortutorial.pdf: Basic mathematical notation for fluid dynamics </b>: The mathematical machinery of fluid dynamics essentially revolves around bookkeeping -- that is, keeping track of the multiple spatial dimensions (x,y,z) and components of flow (u,v,w), as well as derivatives with respect to those quantities. Tensor calculus is a generalization of basic vectorial and calculus operations to arbitrarily high-dimensional systems. This tutorial gives a short review of the mathematical notation necessary for fluid dynamics.

2) <b> Fluidicstutorial.pdf: The Basics of Fluid Dynamics </b>: Much of fluid dynamics revolves around solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, the fundamental equation of fluid flow. The Navier-Stokes equation is essentially a restatement of Newton's third law (F=ma) in a continuum setting. From this equation that governs the dynamics of fluid flows, important physical insights and quantities arise. This tutorial addresses a few important basics of fluid dynamics, including non-dimensionalization and Reynold's number, incompressibility, streamfunction formalism, rate of strain tensor, and the dissipation function.

3) <b> fluiddynamicstutorial.m </b>: A short Matlab tutorial that gives visualizations and illustrates specific teaching points of both tutorial documents.
