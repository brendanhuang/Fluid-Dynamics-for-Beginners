# Fluid-Dynamics-for-Beginners
Two short introductory tutorials on mathematical notation (tensor calculus) and basic fluid dynamics for researchers interested in microfluidics.

These two tutorial documents, which are appendices in my PhD Thesis from Yale University, give a short introduction to two topics:

1)<b> Basic mathematical notation for fluid dynamics </b>: The mathematical machinery of fluid dynamics essentially revolves around bookkeeping -- that is, keeping track of the multiple spatial dimensions (x,y,z) and components of flow (u,v,w), as well as derivatives with respect to those quantities. Tensor calculus is a generalization of basic vectorial and calculus operations to arbitrarily high-dimensional systems.

2) <b> The Basics of Fluid Dynamics </b>:
